# Game Engine Project(s)

I'm love programming games. Game engines handle lot of the work for you.

This can make things easier in the short term but it also prevents you from learning how games work under the hood, and makes you dependent on the engine you chose to learn.

Writing your own game and engine from scratch builds skills that are more transferable to games programming and programming in general.

We'll try to structure things in a way that makes it easy to go through each step of the process, try it yourself, and compare it to what other people did.


## Goals for this project

- to learn all the skills that go into programming a game from scratch
- to do this with other people in a way that makes it easier for everyone
